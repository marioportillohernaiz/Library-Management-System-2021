# Library-Management-System-CW2021

Library Management System Specification.

This library management system has a great GUI which alows quick and easy management of books for a user. It easily
visualises correct input or if any errors were made. This is done by color coding a message box with either green
for correct input, red for wrong input and yellow for any overdue books.
A list and a pie chart are also shown to recommend any books to a previous user or a new user. Previous users are
recommended books which have the same genre or similar genre to the books they have previously checked out. Based on
logic, similar genres are the following, Fiction and Action, Non Fiction and Selfhelp, Drama and Romance. Otherwise,
for any new user, the top 5 checked out books in the log will be recommended for them.
Both the book recommendations and the search book sections of the program contain a Textbox and scroll bars, which
allows the program to display multiple books and for the user to view all of them.
Test codes are also written at the end of each file in order to allow a programmer to test and understand each
fucntion separately. They show which function is used and all the available outputs.
